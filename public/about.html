    <p>this tool amid on the web based bluetooth development task, provide Json file interface for customized profile
        selection. can scan, connect, acting on char seperately or simoutenously, and store the notificaiton data into
        local drive for offline analysis.</p>

        <h3>Bluetooth devices : </h3>
        <p>Hardware : BBC microbit, STM32 Nucelo kit, SensorTile, or any device equipted with BLE 4.x or later<p>
                <p>Firmware/Profile : BBC microbit V1_11, ST BlueST V4.3 or later/FunctionPack ALLMEMS/FLV/MOTENV </p>

                <h3>Known Limitations for current version:</h3>
                <p>1. the FP-SENSING1 (AI) can not be discovered and connected yet</p>
                <p>2. long discover time for ST BlueST profile devices sometime took 20-30seconds</p>
                <p>3. step.1 selectable profiles are not covering the whole original profile yet </p>
                <p> step.1 selectable profile currently have :</p>
                <p> BBC microbit -- on 3 services 4 chars included,</p>
                <p> ST BlueST -- on 1 services upto 4 chars included,</p>

                <h3>release notes:</h3>
                <p>[201019] version 1.1.9 -cubearms is on with new features & bugs:</p>
                <p>1. used absolute angle mapping to the fusion output so that improve the cube/arm display accuracy,
                    and avoided accumulating errors during the rotation obj displayed</p>

                <p>[161019] version 1.1.8 -cubearms is on with new features & bugs:</p>
                <p>1. added arms(2 phase) to arms page</p>
                <p>2. able to trace 2 connected nodes with different movement</p>
                <p>3. limit the arms nodes to 2 so far</p>

                <p>[131019] version 1.1.6 -cube is on with new features & bugs:</p>
                <p>1. added arm(1 phase) to the cube displace</p>
                <p>2. fixed arm(1 phase) colorfill bug</p>
                <p>3. realigned pRy from body to display</p>
                <p>4. re-confirm the samples rate is 20-50hz instead of 166hz due to the nodes throughput ratio, while
                    the filter need at >100hz, so currently we are using less samples to form the filter (samplerate=
                    166, cutoff= 30) inputs</p>

                <p>[051019] version 1.1.5 -cube is on with new features & bugs:</p>
                <p>1. dealt with cube non-cube node ui, and reset to reset cube as well</p>

                <p>[031019] version 1.1.4 -cube is on with new features & bugs:</p>
                <p>1. normalized the acc, gyro reading to match crazepony algorithm needs, now 9axis cube turn looks ok
                    (mag[] == 0, otherwise it shifting a lot - investigate Mag[] ToDo)</p>
                <p>2. reset button will clear the 3D canvas so that ui recovered</p>
                <p>3. add one more canvas so that two cubes can be show same time if two Chars (SFC, 9Axis) notify</p>


                <p>[021019] version 1.1.3 -cube is on with new features & bugs:</p>
                <p>1. add drag and drop feature for char selection - for fusion cube</p>
                <p>2. enabled 3D cube draw when perform cube action while only one cube can be draw today</p>

                <p>[240919] version 1.1.2 is on with new features:</p>

                <p>[110919] version 1.0.0 is on</p>
                <p>the current version (100919) is valid for BlueST (ST BlueST
                    profile, on
                    https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/BlueSTSDK_Android) and
                    Microbit
                    Bluetooth profile(lancaster university project
                    https://lancaster-university.github.io/microbit-docs/ble/profile/)

                    (http://bluetooth-mdw.blogspot.com/2018/12/amsterdamjs-meetup.html)
                    and tested demos included BBC Microbit V1.5 (or later) and
                    STMicroelectronics Nucleo kits and SensorTile (on almost all
                    the
                    FP-ALLMEMs/FLV/MOTENV1 except FP-SENSING1(i.e. AI package)
                    due to
                    some discovery issue pending).</p>
